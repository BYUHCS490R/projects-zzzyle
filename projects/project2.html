    <h1> My Favorite TV Series </h1>
    <p> It's hard picking favorites when there are so many series I like for different reasons. One of my all-time favorites, at any point is definitely <strong> Modern Family.</strong> The show was first released in 2009 and airs until 2020. With 11 seasons &amp; 250 episodes. They have won many awards throughout the years and are probably still watched by many to this day.</p>

    <p>The premise of the show revolves around 3 different families living in Los Angeles. Jay and Gloria have 2 kids: Manny and Joe. Manny is Gloria's son from her first husband; they moved to America from Colombia when she married Jay. Phil and Claire are the typical family one would think, they have 3 kids; the pretty one -  Hailey, the smart one - Alex, and then there's Luke. Cam and Mitchel are a same-sex couple, they have an adopted daughter named Lily.</p> 
    
    <p>As the title suggests, it follows the modern day of these 3 families, many episodes are based on comedy and something that could happen to any family in real life. It's light-hearted, short, and funny. They appeal to any age because every episode is unique.</p>

    <p> I started watching this show back in 2021. I just got home from my mission and was quarantined for a whole month - 2 weeks in a hotel, 2 weeks at home. I was stuck in my room doomscrolling, and I kept seeing clips of the show on Youtube that were funny. I finally decided to watch it after seeing 100+ clips of the show. <mark>It took me 3 months to finish the whole 11 seasons. </mark> Watching it in between lunch breaks, downtime, or even before I go to sleep. Up to this day, I would watch clips or an episode when I feel down or when I just don't know what to watch. It's by far my most watched series since 2021.</p>
