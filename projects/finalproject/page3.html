                <h1>History of Switzerland</h1>

                    <p>Since 1848, Switzerland has existed as a federal republic made up of largely autonomous cantons. Some of these cantons have traditions of self-governance stretching back more than 700 years, making them among the oldest surviving republics in the world.</p>

                    <p>The earliest history of the region is closely connected to Alpine culture. The territory was originally inhabited by the Helvetii and came under Roman control in the 1st century BC. During late period, Gallo-Roman traditions blended with Germanic influences, particularly as eastern Switzerland became part of the Alemannic cultural sphere. By the 6th century, the region was integrated into the Frankish Empire. In the High Middle Ages, the eastern, German-speaking areas belonged to the Duchy of Swabia within the Holy Roman Empire, while the western, French-speaking regions formed part of Burgundy.</p>

                    <p>During the Late Middle Ages, the Old Swiss Confederacy—then consisting of eight cantons—asserted its independence from the House of Habsburg and the Duchy of Burgundy. Switzerland expanded its territory during the Italian Wars, gaining lands south of the Alps from the Duchy of Milan. The Swiss Reformation brought significant religious division, leading to prolonged internal conflicts among the Thirteen Cantons in the Early Modern era. Following the French Revolution, Switzerland was invaded by France in 1798 and reorganized as the Helvetic Republic, a French client state. Napoleon's Act of Mediation in 1803 restored Switzerland as a confederation, but the post-Napoleonic years were marked by political instability. This unrest culminated in a brief civil war in 1847 and ultimately the adoption of a new federal constitution in 1848.</p>

                    <p>From 1848 onward, Switzerland has experienced steady stability, growth, and prosperity. Industrialisation shifted the economy from agriculture to manufacturing, and the country's neutrality during both World Wars—combined with the success of its banking sector—helped solidify Switzerland's reputation as one of the world's most stable economies.</p>

                    <p>Switzerland signed a free-trade agreement with the European Economic Community in 1972 and has taken part in European integration through bilateral agreements. However, it has consistently chosen not to join the European Union (EU), even though since 1995 its territory has been nearly entirely surrounded by EU member states (with the exception of Liechtenstein). In 2002, Switzerland became a member of the United Nations.</p>

                <h1>Traditions</h1>
                    <h2>Music</h2>
                        <p>The most commonly heard musical instruments include the "Schwyzerörgeli" (accordion), the violin, bass violin, clarinet and, in certain regions, the dulcimer or Trümpi (Jew's harp). Alpine folk music developed with the unwritten transfer of skills and compositions over generations, decades and even centuries. The oldest known Kuhreihen (rounds) are from Appenzell and were recorded in 1545. The Alphorn, so typically Swiss, was originally a musical and signaling instrument used by the herdsmen and the many yodeling choirs that have been formed since the 19th century. In general, Switzerland has an extensive amateur music scene, and in virtually every village there is at least a choir or a brass band</p>

                    <h2>Customs and Sports</h2>
                        <p>While regional and local sporting traditions have often been neglected, there are some sports that have enjoyed increasing popularity. Major events such as the Swiss Wrestling and Alpine Festival ESAF are increasing in popularity; in 2010, the festival reached a new record with 250,000 visitors and became the largest Schwingen festival ever held. It is worth noting that no additional police were needed for the maintenance of order, and the authority of the public address announcer was sufficient. At these multi-day festive occasions, athletic wrestlers, sturdy boulder throwers and strong Hornussen players gave of their best - all to the accompaniment of yodel choirs and accordion orchestras.</p>

                    <h2>Folk traditions throughout the year</h2>
                        <p>The festivals celebrated in Switzerland differ considerably depending on the season and the region. Some are based on ancient traditions while others have emerged only recently. Many of them reflect the course of the agricultural year, such as the ringing in of the vineyard workers in spring, the Alpine ascent and descent during the summer months, and the wine festivals, the Chästeilet cheese sharing and the Älplerchilbi carnivals in autumn. Because there was less for farmers to do in winter than in other seasons, there were more celebrations and customs during this time. Even today, the expulsion of winter and of evil spirits and demons forms part of the tradition - a tradition that is linked to the numerous carnival and year-end ceremonies. Other celebrations recall historical events such as important victories in historical battles.</p>
