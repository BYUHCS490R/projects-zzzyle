                <h1>History of Switzerland</h1>

                    <p>Since 1848, Switzerland has been a federal republic, some even running for over 700 years. Making them some of the oldest self-governing regions still around today </p>

                    <p>Switzerland's early history is closely tied to the Alpine culture. The area was first home to the Helvetii before the Romans took control in the 1st century BC. As time passed, Roman and local traditions mixed with Germanic influences, especially in the east. This explains why Switzerland speak German, French, and Romansh.</p>

                    <p>In the late Middle Ages, they started pushing for independence from powerful neighbors like the Habsburgs and Burgundy. Switzerland later grew during the Italian Wars, gaining more power over the lands in the south of the Alps from Milan. After the French Revolution, France invaded in 1798 and turned Switzerland into the Helvetic Republic, basically saying that it is a French-controlled state. This led to civil war in 1847 and finally a new federal constitution was created in 1848.</p>

                    <p>From 1848 and then on, Switzerland has enjoyed stability, growth, and prosperity. As the country grow in population and industrilization, the economy shifted from farming to manufacturing. Switzerland's choice to stay neutral during the World Wars, along with the growth of their eceonomy, helped built their reputation as one of the world's most stable and reliable eceonomies.</p>

                <h1>Traditions</h1>
                    <h2>Music</h2>
                        <p>Tradionally Swiss music features  "Schwyzerörgeli" (accordion), the violin, bass violin, clarinet and, in certain regions, the dulcimer or Trümpi (Jew's harp). Alpine folk music has been passed down for centuries. The Alphorn, one of Switzerland's most iconic instruments. This was originally used by herdsmen to communicate accross mountains, but today it's played in festivals and cultural events. </p>

                    <h2>Customs and Sports</h2>
                        <p>Some traditional Swiss sports such as Wrestling are becoming more popular again, especially at big events like the <em>Swiss Wrestling and Alpine Festival (ESAF)</em>.In 2010, the festival hit a record with 250,000 visitors, making it the largest Schwingen event ever. Schwingen is one of the olderst sports in Switzerland. Two wrestlers compete in a ring, trying to throw each other onto their back using special grips on their opponent's shorts. It is a huge part of Swiss culture, especially in rural areas. </p>

                    <h2>Folk traditions throughout the year</h2>
                        <p>Swiss festivals vary a lot depending by the season and region. Some traditions are centuries old, while other are more recent. Many festivals follow the farming year such as welcoming the vineyard workers in spring, moving cattle up and down the Alps in the summer, and holding wine festivals, cheese-sharing events, and Älplerchilbi carnivals in autumn. Since winters were quieter for farmers, some celebrations involved chasing away winter or evil spirits. Today, these customs live on in Switzerland's lively carnivals, year-end events, and festivals that honor important moments in the country's history.</p>
