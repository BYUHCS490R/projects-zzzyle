        <h2>2. Why</h2> 
            <p>Switzerland has been in my bucketlist to countries I want to visit. The Alps are beautiful in photos what more in person. I've always wanted to see the Alps in person. Though I don't know much about the country, this would be a great opportunity to learn more about Switzerland.</p>
