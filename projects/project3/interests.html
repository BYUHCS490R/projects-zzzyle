        <h1>Interest: Classic Y2K Movies</h1>

        <h4 class="cursive">Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h4>
     
        <p> One of my favorite movies of all time. Eternal Sunshine was released in 2004, the characters Joel is played by Jim Carrey and Clementine by Kate Winslet. The premise of the movie is about the life of Joel and Clementine, who recently broke up. Clementine decided to undergo a process where she erased Joel from her memories, and Joel decided to do the same. However, as Joel's memories are being erased, he begins to realize that he wants to keep his memories of Clementine, leading to a journey through his own mind. A must-watch, I still rewatch it to this day! </p>

        <h4 class="cursive">Mean Girls</h4>
        <p> I mean, who doesn't know Mean Girls? Recently been adapted to be a musical, but the original is definitely superior. First released in 2004, led by Lindsey Lohan. Known for the iconic lines <q> On Wednesdays, we wear pink </q> or <q> That's so fetch</q>. It follows the character named Cady Heron, who grew up in Africa and starts her high school in Illinois. As she figures out social hierarchy, she finds herself in the school's most exclusive group: The Plastics. The movie has a little bit of drama, comedy, romance, and teens just being teens. </p>

        <h4 class="cursive">Legally Blonde</h4>
        <p>Elle Woods proves to everyone who says blondes are just pretty. Played by Reese Witherspoon, the first movie was released in 2001, and then another movie in 2003. Elle Woods is blonde, pretty, rich, stylish, and has a hot boyfriend. Until he decided to leave her for law school, saying she's not 'serious' enough for his future. Determined to get him back, Elle decided to follow him to Harvard Law School. <q> What? Like it's hard?</q>. She proves to everyone that the stereotype of a 'dumb blonde' is wrong and she could be so much more than her pretty looks. </p>

        <p> A relative link specifies a path to another resource (e.g. another HTML page). Below is an example to a Profile Page I made last week. Project 2 is a relative link that will take you to that specific HTML page. While an absolute link is a complete web address that includes a domain name and a specific path to a file or page. Examples below are the movie titles I listed above, these links will take you to Wikipedia for more information.</p>
