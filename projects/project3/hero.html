        <h1> Benedict Cumberbatch</h1>
        <h3> About</h3>
        <p> Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch is an English actor known for his roles in Doctor Strange, The Hobbit, and many more. He has won a lot of awards throughout the years including: 2 Academy awards and 4 Golden Globes. He played a lot of iconic characters such as Stephen Hawking in Hawking (2004), Alan Turing in the Imitation Game (2014) and even Thomas Edison in the Current War (2017).</p>
        <p>He is definitely one of my favorite actors in this century. He has done such a good job in every role he plays. I first saw him in a series of Sherlock Holmes, I never stopped rewatching that series. I followed the series throughout high school, and recently just finished it again earlier this year. His performance in The Hobbit as Smaug is incredible. Behind the scenes will leave you amazed how much effort he puts into his craft. Put him in a movie with a good director, a good plot, I'll pay to watch him anyday! </p>
