            <li> What is the difference between block tags and inline tags? Block tags cover the 100% of the screen, normal flow. While the inline tags are in between regular tags such as strong, span, em etc - a portion of the screen. </li>
            <li> What is the margin, border, and padding? Padding makes sure that the content is in the box. You can put padding only on the top or bottom. Margin is the the outside. Border is a border around the box you can use such as dotted, solid, or dashed and adjust the width of it. (text-align centers texts not boxes)</li>
            <li> What are units of measurement you can use in CSS? pixels, percentages(adjust to the layout of the screen),em unit converts percentages to decimals, points. </li>
            <li> When would you use a figure tag? Figure tag is another block tag, you cant tell it to have an image but it can surround it with an image. </li>
