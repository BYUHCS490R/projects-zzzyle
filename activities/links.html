        <ol>
            <li>Link to an outside website with an absolute link. &check;</li>
            <li>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?<em>The root is the starting point, the website. The path is the sequence where the file or folder are. Folders are to organize files into local groups. File name is the specific file being referenced. </em> </li>
            <li>What is a default document? <em>The default document is the home page. When people click on your domain, the home page is what they see. The most common one is index.html </em></li>
            <li>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?<em>Absoulte link - protocol/domain.path. This is a complete path and refers to the root of the website. While relative is file name only. Relative link can let you change the name in the future. </em></li>
            <li>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder). &check;</li>
            <li>List the 3 rules with relative links.<em> No spaces. Can use letters, digits, but no special characters. If a file is in the same directory as the HTML file containing the link, we just give its name. </em></li> 
            <li>Link to your last project. &check;</li>
            <li>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag? <em>No, links can go anywhere in the page. It could go to the main or the footer as well.  </em></li>
