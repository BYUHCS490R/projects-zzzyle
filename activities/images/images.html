            <li> How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed? On a mac, there's a pencil button and on there's a resize/crop button where you can toggle the size (width and height) and also the pixel of the photo. </li>
            <li> Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? Reducing it on the software makes the image reduce file size. You can avoid distorting the image on CSS when you edit the photos on a software. </li>
