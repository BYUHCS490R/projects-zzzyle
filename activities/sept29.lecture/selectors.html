            <li> <strong>List out the different ways to select an item. </strong> <p>Using IDs, make sure to use a hashtag in CSS when selecting IDs. Using descendant and child rule. Using the tags on the HTML to change it. Using selecting by class. </p> </li>

            <li> <strong>What is the difference between an ID and a Class? </strong><p>When we use ID, we are naming something. Sometimes using IDs, we can have the same name and mess things up. With an ID, you can only have 1 thing named under that name, when you validate it will show up as an error. While classes, you can reuse it for other tags and not show up as an error. You can also use 2 different classes in 1 tag.  </p></li>

            <li> <strong> What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</strong><p> SPAN is selecting within text to do something. A span tag on its own will not work. DIV tag, just like a SPAN tag it's a way to select stuff in a a tag, grouping things together.  </p></li>

            <li> <strong> What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</strong><p> Header, main, footer are just like DIV tags without causing line breaks. DIV is just the generic name, and header, main, footer is html 5 elements</p> </li>

            <li> <strong> What are the different ways to select a color?</strong> <p>Selecting from RGB. Typing the color in the CSS. Hue saturation value, pick a color and choose a saturation for the colo, using HEX codes </p> </li>
